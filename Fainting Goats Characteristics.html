<h2>Characteristics</h2>
<hr>
<p>Slightly smaller than standard breeds of the goat, fainting goats are generally 17 to 25 inches tall and can weigh anywhere from 60 to 174 pounds.[3] Males, or billies, as they are often referred to, can be as heavy as 200 pounds.[3] They have large, prominent eyes in high sockets.[3] Their hair can be short or long, with certain individuals producing a great deal of cashmere during colder months.[3] There appears to be no angora strain of the fainting goat. Common coat colors are black and white; however, most possible coat colors are found in this breed.</p>

<p>Terms previously used to refer to myotonic goats include “falling goats”, “stiff-legged goats”, “falling down goats”, “nervous goats”, "Tennessee goats", “epileptic goats”, and “fainting goats”.[1] They are smaller and somewhat easier to care for and maintain than larger meat goat breeds, which makes the fainting goat desirable for smaller farms. They are also raised as pet or show animals as they can be friendly, intelligent, easy to keep, and amusing.</p>

<p>Fainting goats have a muscle condition called myotonia congenita. Myotonia congenita is a mutation in the genes that affects the skeletal muscles which causes a short term spasm of the muscles after you try to use them.[4] This is a condition that occurs in many species, including humans. The goats do not truly "faint" in any sense of the word, as they never lose consciousness, just temporarily seize.[5]</p>

<p>Classified as a meat goat as opposed to a dairy goat, it can be raised for chevon (goat meat).[6] This breed is listed as threatened by The Livestock Conservancy, so the fainting goat is not used as often for chevon as other meat goat breeds; its rarity makes the live goat more valuable.[6] The main reasons known for continuing to breed these goats has been for the observation of this behaviour as well as their ability to be kept in minimally fenced farms due to their lack of desire to jump over anything over 0.5m.[1] Their size makes them easier to care for during chores such as foot trimming and administering medication. Smaller specimens of fainting goats are frequently kept as pets.</p>

<p>Besides the myotonia, another distinguishing feature of the fainting goat is its prominently set eyes. The eyes protrude from the eye sockets, as opposed to recessed eyes seen in other breeds. The profile is straight as opposed to the convex or "roman" profile.</p>
