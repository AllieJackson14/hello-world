<h2>Cause of "fainting" and additional information</h2>
<p>Myotonia congenita is caused by an inherited disorder of a chloride channel in the muscles of the skeleton (skeletal muscle chloride channel 1, CLCN1).[7] Congenital myotonia can be inherited as an autosomal dominant trait (with incomplete penetrance) or a recessive trait, resulting in the varying severity of the condition.[8][9] In affected goats, the CLCN1 gene contains a missense mutation; the amino acid alanine is replaced with a proline residue.[9] This small change causes the choride channel in the muscle fibres to have a reduced conductance of chloride ions.[10] This missense mutation occurs in a sequence of seven amino acids that are included in a group of closely related channels including that of humans and rats.[8] This causes a delay in the relaxation of the muscles after the goat has made an involuntary movement.[7]</p>

<p>A characterization of myotonia congenita is an increase in the tendency of the skeletal muscles to respond with repetitive action potentials and after discharges when stimulated.[2] The increased muscle excitability has been shown to be largely accounted for by the lack of chloride permeability in these fibers.[2] Myotonia congenita is also characterized by a significant increase in the fast isomyosins in each muscle type in the affected animals.[2] The muscle fibers of the myotonic goat were found to be highly resistant, this was shown to be due to the blocking of chloride conductance.[1] In a study, normal goat muscle fibers were able to be made myotonic by blocking the chloride conductance using myotonia inducing drugs, or by substituting in an anion that is unable to pass through a semi-permeable membrane.[1]</p>

<p>Isolated intercostal muscle from goats with the condition were shown to be significantly different than that of normal goats in terms of temperature dependence of the resting membrane resistance and potassium efflux.[11] These differences help to explain increases in the severity of myotonia in the whole animal that occurs upon decreasing the temperature of the involved muscles.[11]</p>

<p>In a study testing the effect of hydration on myotonia in goats, it was found that upon depriving goats of water, the myotonic symptoms disappeared within 3 days and returned fully within 2-3 days of water being provided.[12] If repeated attacks are precipitated in a goat with severe myotonia within 5-10 minutes of each other, the attacks become less severe, or completely stop altogether.[1] After a period of rest of about 20-30 minutes, a severe attack can be induced again.[1]</p>

<p>Observations were made regarding the development of myotonia congenita in kids. It was observed that there were no abnormalities in percussion responses or stiffness during the first 14 days of a newborn goat’s life.[1] The first percussion responses were observed during days 18-143, and the stiffening and/or falling begins to occur during days 20-173.[1]</p>

<p>Previous studies have reported that taurine, an amino sulphonic acid, when given to myotonic patients can reduce the symptoms of the condition. However, it has been shown that it does not antagonize the condition, nor prevent it.[13]</p>
