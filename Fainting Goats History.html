<h2>History</h2>
<p>Fainting goats were first brought to Marshall County, Tennessee, in the 1880s.[14] By the 1980s, few of the goats remained.[14]</p>

<p>The fainting was first described in scientific literature in 1904, and described as a "congenital myotonia" in 1939.[15] The mutation in the goat gene that causes this muscle stiffness was discovered in 1996, several years after the equivalent gene had been discovered in humans and mice.[15]</p>

<p>The experiments of Brown and Harvey in 1939 with the myotonic goat made a major contribution to the understanding of the physiological basis of this condition and influenced many other theories of myotonia and its causes.[1]</p>
